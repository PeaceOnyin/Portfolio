                Paradventure everyone wont always like you as you, not everyone appreciates the beauty of humanity, but you can always put a smile on your face.
                Life is about bringing out the humanity, make every moment of your life count like you are in control of it while it last. the next moment might be unpredictable, put on a glow always, and be strong. <br>
                "Every man has  his secret sorrows which the world knows not, and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad. there are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more harmful than anything that bleeds"
